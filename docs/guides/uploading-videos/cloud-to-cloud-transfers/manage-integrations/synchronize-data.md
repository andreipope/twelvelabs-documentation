Synchronizing data refers to the process of data being propagated from your cloud storage to the API service. When adding, modifying, or removing files, the changes are not automatically propagated, and you must initiate a synchronization.
To initiate a synchronization, go to the [Integrations](https://api.twelvelabs.io/integrations) page, choose a bucket, and select the **Synchronize Data** icon which is the second from the left:

The API service automatically initiates a synchronization when you select the **Get JSON** button.
